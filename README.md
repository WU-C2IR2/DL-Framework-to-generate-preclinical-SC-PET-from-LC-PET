# Deep Learning Framework forgenerating preclinical SC-PET images from LC-PET realizations
This repository provides the code for a deep-learning based framework for generation and multi-objective evaluation of preclinical Standard-Count PET (SC-PET) images from different realizations of Low-Count PET (LC-PET) images. To that end in this project we have developed and optimized a novel deep-learning architecture called Attention based Residual Dilated Network (ARD-Net). The performance of ARD-Net generated SC-PET images were benchmarked against other deep-learning methods i.e. Residual UNet (RU-Net) and Dilated Net (D-Net) and non deep-learning denoisers like Non-Local Means (NLM) and Block Matching and 3D Filtering (BM3D).
